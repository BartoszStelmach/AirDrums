Above is the link to the presentation of the Java application that allows the user to simulate playing drums. This app requires only a computer with the webcam and drumsticks with some colorful markers on their tips.

Application uses the camera to capture the image of the the player and then processes it, so the parts of the drumsticks responsible for making the sounds - the colored tips - can be recognized by the program. Positions of the virtual drums and cymbals are set by the user before playing.

For the most of the image processing work, Java wrapper of the library OpenCv is used.
Simple GUI was made using JavaFX.
